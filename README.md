# rsps-snippets
Here I'l put some of my own 718 RSPS snippets for you guys

# What are RSPS snippets?
RSPS stands for RuneScape Private Server, and I do all of these for educational purposes

# Did you code these by yourself?
Yeah, of course I did, and I do post some coding lives at my livestream channel (twitch.tv/godzamy)

# Can I use these on my server?
Yes for sure, just remind to leave my credits on the file and never touch that :)

# Some of my own scripts
