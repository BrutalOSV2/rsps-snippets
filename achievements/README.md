# achievements
In these snippet, I show my achievements system that I created to learn better how to use enums and etc. This is missing the custom interface but
with this you guys should be able to understand how to do systems like this to your projects.

# Usage
`Achievements.checkAchievementStatus(player, Achievements.Store.<TASK_NAME_LOCATED_ON_STORE>, <QUANTITY_TO_BE_ADDED (1 as default)>);`

# Credits
[Andreas](https://www.rune-server.ee/members/-andreas/) - Helped me with some parts of the interface sending method, this way I could finish it faster, thanks bud =).
